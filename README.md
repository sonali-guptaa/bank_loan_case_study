# Project Description:
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns indicating potential loan default among urban customers applying for various types of loans. The dataset contains information about loan applications, including customer attributes and loan attributes.

# Project Goal
The main objective is to identify patterns that indicate a customer's potential for payment difficulties. This information can be used for informed loan decisions such as:
- Denying loans to high-risk applicants.
- Reducing loan amounts for moderate-risk borrowers.
- Setting higher interest rates for customers with a higher risk of default.
By understanding the key factors behind loan defaults, the company aims to make better loan approval decisions.

# Business Objectives:
The primary objective is to understand how customer attributes and loan attributes influence the likelihood of default. By identifying patterns indicating potential payment difficulties, the company can make informed decisions such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, or offering loans at higher interest rates to risky applicants. The ultimate goal is to improve the company's decision-making process regarding loan approval.

# Data Analysis Tasks
This project performs various EDA tasks on a loan application dataset containing information on approved, cancelled, refused, and unused offer loan applications. The dataset includes two scenarios:
- Customers with payment difficulties: Borrowers with late payments on initial installments.
- Customers with on-time payments: Borrowers with a history of on-time payments.

# The analysis focuses on the following aspects:
- Missing Data Identification and Handling: Identifying missing data points and employing appropriate methods (e.g., imputation) to address them.
- Outlier Detection: Identifying and investigating outliers in numerical variables to ensure accurate analysis.
- Data Imbalance Assessment: Determining if the dataset has an imbalanced distribution of loan default cases and calculating the imbalance ratio.
- Univariate, Segmented Univariate, and Bivariate Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of individual variables, comparing distributions across scenarios, and exploring relationships between variables and loan defaults.
- Top Correlation Identification: Identifying the variables with the strongest correlations with loan default for both customer scenarios.

# Deliverables
This project will deliver insights and visualizations obtained through EDA, including:
- Identification of missing data and chosen handling methods.
- Detection of outliers and justification for their treatment.
- Assessment of data imbalance and its ratio.
- Univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analysis results with visualizations (histograms, bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots, etc.).
- Identification of top correlations for both customer scenarios with visualizations (correlation matrices or heatmaps).

This project will contribute to building a robust loan approval system by identifying key factors associated with loan defaults.
